    <p>In mid-June, I undertook the challenge and adventure of becoming open-water certified in scuba diving with my family. We learned about all of the equipment, techniques, and physical skills necessary for breathing under, and swimming on top of water.</p>

<p>We started out with two confined-water dives in a hotel swimming pool. First, we completed a few swimming tests including treading water for ten minutes and swimming 500 yards. We also learned all the essential skills such as setting up and putting on our gear, breathing techniques, and even emergency situation scenarios. We had to show that we could deal with running out of air while underwater. Our fabulous instructors turned off our air supplies, and our buddy swam over to give us their secondary regulator. The confined dives were informational, but we were ready to head out into the ocean.</p>

<p>Diving in a swimming pool did not prepare me for what was to come out in the ocean. The colorful corals were teeming with a diversity of life. Curious sharks, giant barracudas lingering in the shadows under the boat, crabs scuttling across the ocean floor, lobsters taking refuge in a small cave, and schools of iridescent fish hiding under corals. Swimming in the deep water was like flying. But it wasn’t all fun and games; We had work to do too.</p>

<p>We finished up our training over two days in the ocean. We practiced what we learned in the confined water dive. And we also learned other skills that were not possible in a swimming pool, such as navigating with a compass, or emergency ascents. Now that I am open-water certified, so much more of the world has opened up to me. I can’t wait to see what’s next!</p>
