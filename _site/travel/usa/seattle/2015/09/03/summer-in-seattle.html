    <p>In the summer of 2015, I started my second internship with Boeing. Rather than stay at home this time, I decided to move out to the Seattle location. Not only did I want to see the Boeing operation in Seattle, but I heard Washington was a beautiful place.</p>

<h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>

<p>I had to get from Saint Louis, Missouri to Seattle, Washington. So I naturally decided to roadtrip the entire distance. The driving the 2,085 miles only took me four days, and my car only broke down once! I stopped by Yellowstone for a day, where I saw wild buffalo, elk, bears, and sulfur pits.</p>

<h2 id="living-and-working-in-seattle">Living and Working in Seattle</h2>

<p>I loved Seattle. Living in between the mountains and the oceans was spectacular. It was almost as good as the coffee. I learned much at Boeing and hiked many places in Washington.</p>

<h2 id="hiking-in-the-cascades">Hiking in the Cascades</h2>

<p>Living 20 minutes away from the mountain range, I was able to get out and hike at least once a week. From day hikes, to week-long hikes.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-coast">Exploring the Coast</h2>

<p>Living only a couple hours drive from the Western coast of the United States, I went on a few trips here and there. Exploring Olympic National Park and the Puget Sound area was wonderful.</p>

<h2 id="heading-home">Heading Home</h2>

<p>Just before heading home my brother came to visit. We hiked around Washington for a bit and then roadtripped back home. We visited the clearest lake in the United States, a random quarry called the Hippie Hole, Devils Tower, and Mount Rushmore.</p>
