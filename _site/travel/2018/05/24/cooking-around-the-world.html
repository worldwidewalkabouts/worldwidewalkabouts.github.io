    <p>I’ve always been interested in cooking, but when at home, I usually just stick to whatever is easiest, so that I can get back to my work or studies. Over the past eight months, I learned to cook (and eat) many dishes from around the world.</p>

<h2 id="momos">Momos</h2>

<p>These spicy, mouthwatering dumplings native to Tibet, Nepal, and India were a staple in my diet while living in Nepal. I first heard of them when in Thamel, the tourist district of Kathmandu. Just like most dumplings, they can contain anything you like. While learning to cook these delicious morsels in a cooking class, we put vegetables, chicken, and even snickers inside!</p>

<p>For most of my time volunteering in Sindhupalchok, Nepal, we ate Dal Bhat. But eventually, the local family who cooked our food made enough money from us to buy a steamer, which they used to cook chicken, buffalo, and vegetable momos. We watched them cook, and anytime they needed meat, they had to kill one of their own livestock. It was a fantastic learning experience.</p>

<h2 id="cooking-with-friends">Cooking with Friends</h2>

<p>While living with others in Nepal, Japan, and Indonesia, we would occasionally have group dinners where everyone pitched in to help cook. I learned how to cook so many dishes from around the world. In Nepal, I spent Thanksgiving and Christmas on our base. We had to cook for about twenty people. I learned about cooking French crepes, cakes, soups, roti, and much more.</p>

<h2 id="okonomiyaki">Okonomiyaki</h2>

<p>In Japan, the foodie in me flourished. I loved everything I ate in Japan, but Okonomiyaki was my favorite. The name directly translates to “grill how you like.” It is basically a savory pancake made from flour, bean sprouts, soba noodles, plus anything else you want. When spending some time with a Couchsurfer, he taught me how to cook this wonderful dish. We used octopus and beef.</p>

<p>I learned so much. And I would love to continue my cooking skills in the future.</p>
