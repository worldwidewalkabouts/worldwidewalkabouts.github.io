Our only guide, Báo, lives just in the foothills of the same mountain we set out to climb. We stayed at his place with his family before and after the hike, eating delicious dinners, getting to know each other, and playing with all of his animals. In addition to being a trekking guide, Báo and his family grow rice and corn in terraces, and cardamom in the jungle.

After grabbing some pork, veggies, and other goodies from a local highland market, we set out to climb. We spent the night at a quaint trekker's shelter run by two friendly Dao women, who built the shelter two years ago to help trekkers brace the elements such as heavy rain and landslides.

Our dinner that night consisted of our supplies from the market as well as some cardamom picked from the jungle along the way. Everyone got to know each other around the fire through Vietnamese, Dao, and a little English.
