One of my favorite activities to do in a city is to randomly walk through all kinds of markets.

## Thailand

From squid to octopus, or eels to bullfrogs, you can find anything and everything for sale in a Bangkok market. Shops and stalls are packed in between larger buildings. You can easily get lost in the alleyways. And if you stand around long enough, you can witness a customer ordering, and watching as the owner slices up the new purchase.

## Nepal

Nepal’s markets were full of food, but also clothing, accessories and cooking supplies. Just like Bangkok, shops and stalls are crammed in everywhere possible. In Thamel, you can buy cheap knock-offs of North Face, or Mountain Hardwear. For my volunteer work, I bought a sleeping bag, tent, a cargo bag, and mattress for $45. They weren’t the best quality, but they did the trick!

## Indonesia

So many bananas. And papayas, dragonfruit, mangos, and fruit in general. I tried so many new fruits, vegetables, and spices while wandering markets and working on a permaculture farm. All of the fruits were unprecedentedly fresh. I could go up to a mango tree on the street, pick, and eat a mango and it would be on par with the best.

## Hong Kong

Hong Kong is famous for meat of all kinds. Duck, goose, fish, pork, beef, and anything else. You can buy stuffed intestines on the street. Dim sum is also popular. You can buy all sorts of buns and dumplings on the street. There are also markets dedicated to only selling fruit. Dragonfruit from Taiwan, Durian from Thailand, you name it!
