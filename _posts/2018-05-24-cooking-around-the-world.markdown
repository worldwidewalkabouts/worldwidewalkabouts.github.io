I’ve always been interested in cooking, but when at home, I usually just stick to whatever is easiest, so that I can get back to my work or studies. Over the past eight months, I learned to cook (and eat) many dishes from around the world.

## Momos

These spicy, mouthwatering dumplings native to Tibet, Nepal, and India were a staple in my diet while living in Nepal. I first heard of them when in Thamel, the tourist district of Kathmandu. Just like most dumplings, they can contain anything you like. While learning to cook these delicious morsels in a cooking class, we put vegetables, chicken, and even snickers inside!

For most of my time volunteering in Sindhupalchok, Nepal, we ate Dal Bhat. But eventually, the local family who cooked our food made enough money from us to buy a steamer, which they used to cook chicken, buffalo, and vegetable momos. We watched them cook, and anytime they needed meat, they had to kill one of their own livestock. It was a fantastic learning experience.

## Cooking with Friends

While living with others in Nepal, Japan, and Indonesia, we would occasionally have group dinners where everyone pitched in to help cook. I learned how to cook so many dishes from around the world. In Nepal, I spent Thanksgiving and Christmas on our base. We had to cook for about twenty people. I learned about cooking French crepes, cakes, soups, roti, and much more.

## Okonomiyaki

In Japan, the foodie in me flourished. I loved everything I ate in Japan, but Okonomiyaki was my favorite. The name directly translates to “grill how you like.” It is basically a savory pancake made from flour, bean sprouts, soba noodles, plus anything else you want. When spending some time with a Couchsurfer, he taught me how to cook this wonderful dish. We used octopus and beef.

I learned so much. And I would love to continue my cooking skills in the future.
