While living in Kyoto, Japan, I decided to take a trip to Osaka to watch a day of the Grand Sumo Tournament.

The bouts are intense, but most only last a handful of seconds each. The warmups last four minutes, and contain much stomping, slapping, and salt throwing. If a competitor touches the floor of the ring with anything but his feet, or leaves the ring, he loses. As time goes on, to higher and higher divisions, the bouts and ceremonial warmups become ever more fierce. As the entire arena filled with people, their yelling growing greater, I gripped the edge of my seat.

However intense the bouts become, the tradition and ceremony is equally majestic. From ringed displays to bow-twirling, the tradition behind sumo wrestling is elaborate and well-practiced. I’m glad I had the chance to experience this side of Japan’s culture.
