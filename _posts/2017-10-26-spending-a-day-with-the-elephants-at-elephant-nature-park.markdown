Elephants are gentle giants. They are intelligent and social creatures. Unfortunately, many elephants in Thailand are abused for tourism purposes. When visiting Elephant Nature Park, a sanctuary for abused elephants, I learned about the abuse elephants endure so that tourists can ride them. I also learned about how to feed, bath, and play with the elephants.

We went to a small farm, the owner of which elected to stop using his elephants for riding, and instead allow Elephant Nature Park to bring people there to show them how elephants behave in their natural habitat. We fed them bananas and sugar cane, gave them mud baths, and walked them through a river.
