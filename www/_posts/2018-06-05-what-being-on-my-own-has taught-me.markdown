After eight months of being on my own out in this world, I’m bound to learn something about myself, other people, or the world in general. And I believe I have. I improved my social skills, I reordered my priorities, and I wrote more often.

## Branching out, and growing accustomed to living outside of my comfort zone

Before embarking on my journey, I would have considered myself rather introverted. I was shy around strangers, especially when there was no purpose for conversation. I typically avoided people, even if I needed help with directions or information. On occasion, I would have actually rather walked five miles, then confront someone and ask about how the public transportation functioned. And that’s not just because I like walking.

One of my top priorities while walking around these past eight months was to learn to become more extroverted. I started slowly at first, but then, as it became easier, I flourished. I started off by putting myself in situations where I would talk with people. I would jump at any opportunity to meet someone new. Whether it was going up to a random group of people at a hostel and striking up a conversation, meeting someone on Couchsurfing to explore the city, or proactively arranging dinners, coffee dates, or activities with people that I knew I would be in contact with in the future.

Then, as I had more and more practice with conversing with people, and the anxiety started to fade, I focused on having good conversations. I needed to first define what a good conversation meant to me. For me, a good conversation involves learning as much about the other person(s) with whom I am talking. Keeping the focus and topic of conversation on the other person(s), rather than myself. I tried to actively listen, and to ask relevant questions that would further the conversation. Only when the other person actually asked a question about myself would I talk about myself.

The next step was to be more optimistic. Smile more. Only talk about positive thoughts. Or if it is unavoidable, talk about a negative thought in a positive way. Look at the bright side. At first, this was slightly forced. But over time, as I actively learned more about the people I was around, I started to gather a growing empathy for everyone. I felt genuinely happy for other people when they achieved something, or told a story about their own life. By having good conversations with people, I cared for them more. This really showed during my time in Nepal, where I spent four months around the same group of people. Living together, working together, and playing together made it easy to learn more and more about others.

## Worrying less about material possessions

Before heading out, I knew that I wanted to worry less about my stuff. But I never thought it would be possible. In previous travels, I met people who would just leave their belongings on their dorm bed, where anyone could just take it. I also met people who would entrust their entire bag to a stranger. And these weren’t strictly personal belongings that had no intrinsic value. Laptops, cameras, passports, or phones were among these belongings. I was completely taken aback in these situations. How could someone just leave all of their belongings somewhere like that? I would be worrying constantly. So much so that I wouldn’t enjoy the current moment. I eventually found a solution, but it was far from what I ever expected to find.

Instead of just learning to worry less, I had an entire shift in my priorities and thinking. By having better conversations with people, making genuine friends, and enjoying people’s company more, I started to value my experiences more than my possessions. And those are impossible to steal. Obviously, I still carried my phone, passport, and wallet on me in sketchy situations, but I was completely fine with leaving my laptop, camera, and entire backpack somewhere vulnerable.

In addition to worrying less, I actually used my possessions less. Most of the time, especially in Nepal, I didn’t have internet access. I never used my phone or laptop. And because of this I was able to enjoy the company of others. The current moment, the people around me, and truly living became more important than my things.

## Worrying less about the future and planning

I wouldn’t say that I am a planner necessarily, but I do like to have a little certainty about the future. During the last eight months, nothing was certain. I had no idea what was next. And at first, I worried about it. But as time went on, and I learned how to enjoy the current moment by making good friends and having great experiences. And the future became less important. I wasn’t able to cut out worrying entirely. But I am more comfortable accepting the fact that what will happen, will happen.

## All In All

By learning to have meaningful conversations, worrying less, and living in the current moment, I had a happier life. I was able to branch out and leave my comfort zone. And I was able to truly understand what was important to me as a person. I’m incredibly lucky to have had an experience such as this. And I hope to continue having them in the future!
