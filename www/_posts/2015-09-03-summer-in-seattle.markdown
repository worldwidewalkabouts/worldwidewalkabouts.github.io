In the summer of 2015, I started my second internship with Boeing. Rather than stay at home this time, I decided to move out to the Seattle location. Not only did I want to see the Boeing operation in Seattle, but I heard Washington was a beautiful place.

## Getting There

I had to get from Saint Louis, Missouri to Seattle, Washington. So I naturally decided to roadtrip the entire distance. The driving the 2,085 miles only took me four days, and my car only broke down once! I stopped by Yellowstone for a day, where I saw wild buffalo, elk, bears, and sulfur pits.

## Living and Working in Seattle

I loved Seattle. Living in between the mountains and the oceans was spectacular. It was almost as good as the coffee. I learned much at Boeing and hiked many places in Washington.

## Hiking in the Cascades

Living 20 minutes away from the mountain range, I was able to get out and hike at least once a week. From day hikes, to week-long hikes.

## Exploring the Coast

Living only a couple hours drive from the Western coast of the United States, I went on a few trips here and there. Exploring Olympic National Park and the Puget Sound area was wonderful.

## Heading Home

Just before heading home my brother came to visit. We hiked around Washington for a bit and then roadtripped back home. We visited the clearest lake in the United States, a random quarry called the Hippie Hole, Devils Tower, and Mount Rushmore.
