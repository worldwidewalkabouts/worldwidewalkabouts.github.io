Spending a month and a half in Japan was a thrilling, fast-paced experience. Compared to living in Nepal, Japan was  futuristically alien.

## Tokyo

Starting off in Tokyo, I wanted to explore as many alleys and corners as possible. I went to a sushi market, wandered around neon-lit streets, met up with a few Couchsurfers, and went to a Couchsurfing meet up to meet some friends.

I met a Couchsurfer that showed me around her hometown of Kamakura, where we had green tea ice cream and famous sausages, went to a couple temples, and explored cliffs at the ocean.

I met a Couchsurfer from Nakano, a part of Tokyo famous for collectors of anything and everything. We went to Asakusa to see some temples and the \"Golden Poop,\" Kappabashi Dogu Street to watch how display food is created, and ate Okonomiyaki, a savory Japanese pancake, for the first time.

I met a Couchsurfer from Beijing who had been living in Tokyo for the past year. We ate some delicious Chinese food, and went to a local improv jazz session.

## Kyoto

Spending a month in Kyoto, I volunteered in a traditional guest house dating back to the Edo period, over 500 years ago. The houses were traditional, but the staff and volunteers were foreigners. The work consisted of repairs or construction. And we hosted weekly language cafes for locals to come and practice their English while playing games.

While volunteering in Kyoto, I used the guest house's rental bikes to ride all over the city. Kyoto has so much to offer. I hiked, tried food of all varieties, visited temples, sang karaoke, and tried my hand at cooking various Japanese foods.

After the rest of my travels in Japan, I came back to Kyoto to see the cherry blossoms. Everywhere you look in Kyoto, there are cherry blossom trees. I spent hours walking along the river looking at these beautiful trees.

## Osaka and Nara

While volunteering in Kyoto, I took a break to head to Osaka and Nara. In Osaka, I watched a day of the Grand Sumo Tournament, walked around astonishing architecture in Namba, and visited many manga, anime, and figurine shops. In Nara, I rented a bike and hung out with domestic deer, visited temples, and went on hikes.

## Hiroshima and Shobara

Once I finished volunteering, I headed to Hiroshima. I wanted to visit the museums and buildings related to the atomic bombing during World War II. And visit Miyajima island to see the Great Torii, a gate partially submerged in water.

I also stayed with a Couchsurfer in Shobara, a small city in the middle of Japan. He showed me around his city and introduced me to other locals. We explored caves, went fishing, cooked Okonomiyaki, went to a wine festival, and even went to my first Sento, a public bath.

## Kobe

My next stop was Kobe, famous for mouthwatering, perfectly marbled beef, but also for the world's longest suspension bridge, and spices. I only spent a day here, but I was able to see and taste so much.

## Transportation

Getting around Japan is delightfully convenient, but bloody expensive. To transport myself from one location to another, I took trains, planes, taxis, trams, buses, and bullet trains.

Taking the tram, metro, or local buses was the cheapest option, but also the most confusing. Without a convenient method (in English) to look up routes, it was sometimes difficult.

Finding your way via a subway map, especially in Tokyo, has a steep learning curve. But I think that was half of the fun!

I took a $130 USD bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto. While the experience was worth it, I don't think I would choose this as my main mode of transport. Night buses are much cheaper.

## Vending Machines

Want something? Anything? You can probably find it in a vending machine somewhere in Japan. From magazines, hot coffee, cold beer, or toys.
