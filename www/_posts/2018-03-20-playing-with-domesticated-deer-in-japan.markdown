In Japan, the deer are as polite as the citizens. In many areas throughout Japan, but especially Nara, deer interact and socialize with people on the street.

In Nara, I witnessed, at least a few times, a deer waiting for the crosswalk signal, and then walking across the street once the cars stopped.

But they will also bow to you if you present them with food. And they like to hang out near temples and parks. I spent some time hiking around and playing with the hundreds of deer just laying about.

In Miyajima Island, there were also domesticated deer, which played in the shallow waters near the beach.
